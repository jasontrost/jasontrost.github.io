        <!-- Short Bio -->
        <h2 class="section-title">Short Bio (For Press)</h2>
        <div class="bio-box">
            <p>Jason Trost is the founder and CEO of Smarkets, one of the world's largest prediction markets. Founded in 2008 when he left UBS to challenge the industry monopoly, Smarkets now processes billions in annual volume across 200,000+ customers. A Computer Science graduate from Northwestern University, Trost has spent 18 years building prediction market infrastructure—longer than almost anyone in the space. He's based in London and with one foot in the US.</p>

        <!-- Extended Bio -->
        <h2 class="section-title">The Full Story</h2>

        <p><strong>Everyone thinks prediction markets just became a thing.</strong> Most of today's players launched in 2020 or later. The media discovered them in 2024. I've been watching hype cycles come and go since 2008, learning what actually works.</p>

        <p>I founded Smarkets at 26 after quitting my software developer job at UBS. Armed with a Computer Science degree from Northwestern and experience in financial markets, the idea was simple: the incumbent was charging 5% commission and had terrible UX. We could do 2% with better design. Everyone said we were crazy to challenge a monopoly. They were probably right.</p>

        <p>The first seven years nearly killed us. We burned through millions, rebuilt the platform three times, and came close to shutting down more than once. What kept us going was what I call "extreme hubris with extreme work ethic"—the dangerous combination of believing you're right when everyone says you're wrong, and working obsessively to prove it.</p>

        <p>In 2015, things clicked. We'd figured out the hardest problem in prediction markets: <span class="highlight">liquidity</span>. Not by hoping users would provide it (they won't), but by running our own trading desk to seed markets. Today, Smarkets processes billions in volume annually across sports, politics, and entertainment markets.</p>

        <p>I've watched this space long enough to see patterns. The current boom feels different—real money, real regulation, real institutional interest. But I've also seen enough cycles to stay cautiously optimistic. Prediction markets are hard. Most will fail. The winners will be those who understand that <strong>market design beats marketing</strong> and <strong>liquidity beats everything</strong>.</p>

        <!-- What I've Learned -->
        <h2 class="section-title">Hard-Won Lessons</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Liquidity is everything.</strong> Without it, you're just a website with good intentions.</li>
            <li><strong>Market makers > market takers.</strong> We run our own trading desk because users won't provide liquidity.</li>
            <li><strong>2% beats 5%.</strong> Lower commissions drive volume. We proved this against the incumbents.</li>
            <li><strong>Politics gets press, sports makes money.</strong> One is marketing, the other is business.</li>
            <li><strong>Regulation is a moat, not a barrier.</strong> Getting licensed filters out the tourists.</li>
            <li><strong>The US is different.</strong> What works in Europe doesn't translate. I learned this the hard way.</li>
            <li><strong>Prediction markets ≠ betting.</strong> Similar mechanics, completely different user psychology.</li>
            <li><strong>Everyone's an expert in a bull market.</strong> The real test is surviving the winters.</li>
        </ul>
